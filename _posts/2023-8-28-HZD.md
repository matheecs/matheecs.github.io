## HZD Framework

Give EoM

$$
D(q)\ddot q+H(q,\dot q)=Bu
$$

where configuration coordinates $q \in \mathcal{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Let full system state be given by $x = (q, \dot q) \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathrm{T} \mathcal{Q}$

In state space the EoM becomes

$$
\dot{x}=f(x)+g(x) u
$$

By combining the continuous dynamics within a domain and the reset map, the single-domain hybrid control
system is obtained

$$
\mathcal{H C}= \begin{cases}\dot{x}=f(x)+g(x) u & x \notin \mathcal{S} \\ x^{+}=\Delta\left(x^{-}\right) & x^{-} \in \mathcal{S}\end{cases}
$$

The idea behind the HZD framework is to reduce the hybrid dynamical system into a lower dimensional system. Virtual constraints

$$
y_\alpha(q):=y^a(q)-y^d(\tau(q), \alpha)
$$

When the outputs and their derivatives are equal to zero, we say that the residual dynamics evolve on the **zero dynamics surface**, defined as

$$
\mathcal{Z}_\alpha:=\left\{x \in \mathcal{D} \mid y_\alpha(q)=0, \dot{y}_\alpha(q)=0\right\}
$$

to ensure stability of the hybrid system as a whole, we must ensure that the outputs remain zero through impact. This impactinvariance condition is often termed the **HZD condition**

$$
\Delta\left(\mathcal{S} \cap \mathcal{Z}_\alpha\right) \in \mathcal{Z}_\alpha
$$
