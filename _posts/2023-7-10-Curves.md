## type1: Bezier

A Bezier curve is a parametric curve defined by a set of control points ${p_0, p_1, ..., p_n}$ where $n$ is its order. The curve passes through its first and last control point.

All Bezier curves of order superior to 3 can be represented as Bezier curves of order 3 or less joined end-to-end, where the last control point of one curve coincides with the first control point of the next curve.

## type2: Polynomials

Represents a polynomial of an arbitrary order defined on the interval $[t_{min}, t_{max}]$.

## type3: Cubic Hermite

A cubic hermite spline is a polynomial curve of degree 3, defined by its initial and final positions and velocities : $P_i$, $P_{i+1}$ and $m_i$, $m_{i+1}$.

## Piecewise Curves $\equiv\{ Cf_0, Cf_1,...Cf_N\}$

* $Pc$ defined in $[Tmin, Tmax]$
* $\forall i \subset \{0,1,...,N\}$, $Cf_i$ is defined in $[Tmin_i, Tmax_i]$
* $\forall i \subset \{0,1,...,N\}$, $Tmax_i = Tmin_{i+1}$
* $Tmin_0=Tmax$ and $Tmax_N=Tmax$
