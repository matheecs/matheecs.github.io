# How to think in JAX

* JAX arrays are **immutable**, meaning that once created their contents cannot be changed.
* `jax.numpy` is a high-level wrapper that provides a familiar interface.
* `jax.lax` is a lower-level API that is stricter and often more powerful.
* All JAX operations are implemented in terms of operations in **XLA** â€“ the Accelerated Linear Algebra compiler.

![](https://github.com/openxla/xla/raw/main/docs/images/openxla_dark.svg)

* Not all JAX code can be JIT compiled, as it requires array **shapes** to be **static** & **known** at compile time.
* Variables that you donâ€™t want to be traced can be marked as **static**.
* Control flow statements in the function cannot depend on traced values.
* Understanding which values and operations will be static and which will be traced.
* Just as values can be either static or traced, operations can be static or traced.
* Static operations are evaluated at compile-time in Python; traced operations are compiled & evaluated at run-time in XLA.
* Use `numpy`     for operations that you want to be static.
* Use `jax.numpy` for operations that you want to be traced.

# Debugging runtime values

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

@jax.jit
def f(x):
  jax.debug.print("ðŸ¤¯ {x} ðŸ¤¯", x=x)
  y = jnp.sin(x)
  jax.debug.breakpoint()
  jax.debug.print("ðŸ¤¯ {y} ðŸ¤¯", y=y)
  return y

f(2.)
# Prints:
# ðŸ¤¯ 2.0 ðŸ¤¯
# Enters breakpoint to inspect values!
# ðŸ¤¯ 0.9092974662780762 ðŸ¤¯
```

# GPU performance tips

```python
import os
os.environ['XLA_FLAGS'] = (
    '--xla_gpu_triton_gemm_any=True '
    '--xla_gpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true '
)
```

# Pytrees

* Any object whose type is not in the pytree container registry is considered a leaf pytree.
* Any object whose type is in the pytree container registry, and which contains pytrees, is considered a pytree.
