##### LEGO“积木”

1. **卷积层**
2. 汇合层
3. 激活函数
4. 全连接层
5. 目标函数

Loosely speaking, assume that we have a W\*H **Image** with depth D at each input location. For each location, we get a K\*K **Patch**, which could be considered as a K\*K\*D vector, and apply M **Filters** to it. In pseudocode, this is (ignoring boundary conditions):

```c++
for w in 1..W
  for h in 1..H
    for x in 1..K
      for y in 1..K
        for m in 1..M
          for d in 1..D
            output(w, h, m) += input(w+x, h+y, d) * filter(m, x, y, d)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
