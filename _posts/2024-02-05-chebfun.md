Each smooth piece is mapped to the interval [−1, 1] and represented by an expansion in Chebyshev polynomials of the form

$$
f_N(x)=\sum_{j=0}^N \lambda_j T_j(x), \quad x \in[-1,1]
$$

where $T_j(x)=\cos (j \arccos (x))$. When constructing a fun object, the system computes the coefficients λj by interpolating the target function f at N + 1 Chebyshev extreme points

$$
x_j=\cos \frac{\pi j}{N}, \quad j=0, \ldots, N
$$

The polynomial degree N is automatically determined so that the representation is as accurate as possible in double precision arithmetic.
