## How Behavior Trees Modularize Hybrid Control Systems

> We also show that BTs can be seen as generalizations of three classical concepts from the robot control literature, the subsumption architecture [19], sequential behavior compositions [20], and decision trees [21].

> The subsumption architecture [19] is a control structure where a number of controllers are executed in parallel, and higher priority controllers subsume (or suppress), the lower priority ones, whenever needed.

> Sequential behavior compositions were introduced in [20] and built upon in, e.g., [22]. The key idea is that the region of attraction of a controller can be increased by combining a set of different controllers, where each controller drives the system state into the region of attraction of another controller, closer to the overall goal state.

> Decision trees [21] is a control structure where the controllers are found at the leaves of the tree, and the interior nodes of the tree represent state-dependent predicates, which determine what branches to follow from the root to one of the leaves.
