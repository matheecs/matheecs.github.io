Ghost in Rotation

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol \omega}_{ab}^a = \dot{\mathbf R}_{ab} \mathbf R_{ab}^{-1}
$$

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol \omega}_{ab}^b = \mathbf R_{ab}^{-1} \dot{\mathbf R}_{ab}
$$

Nonholonomic system[^1]

> Conclusions have been derived then concerning the holonomy of the Newton equation and the **nonholonomy** of the Euler equation, implying the necessity of contact forces for articulated systems to realize translations, but not rotations for which joint forces are enough.[^2]
> As a result, controlling the angular momentum does not induce a control of either joint configuration or global orientation (due to its nonholonomy). The opposite is true however: controlling joint configuration and global orientation does induce a control of the angular momentum as a derived quantity.[^3]
