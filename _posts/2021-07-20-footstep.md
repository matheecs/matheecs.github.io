# ## Problem Description
#
# In this notebook we will implement a simplified footstep planner for a humanoid robot: we will use the method proposed [in this paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Deits14a.pdf).
# The idea is straightforward: we need to plan where to place the feet of the robot in order to move from point A to point B.
# In doing so, we are allowed to place the feet only in certain safe areas ("stepping stones") and each step cannot exceed a certain length.
# To solve this problem, we will use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP).
#
# MIQP is a relatively nice class of optimization problems.
# The [branch and bound algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) allows to solve these problems to global optimality, whenever a solution exists, and it certifies infeasibility otherwise.
# The drawback, however, is that computation times scale exponentially with the number of integer variables in the problem.
#
# You will be asked to code most of the components of this MIQP:
# - The constraint that limit the maximum step length.
# - The constraint for which a foot cannot be in two stepping stones at the same time.
# - The constraint that assign each foot to a stepping stone, for each step of the robot.
# - The objective function that minimizes the sum of the squares of the step lengths.
#
# Before moving on, take a look at the following videos to see the Atlas robot using this algorithm!

# ## Building the Terrain
#
# We start by constructing the terrain in which the robot will walk.
# For simplicity, we let the stepping stones be rectangles in the plane.
#
# We define each stepping stone by its `center` (2d vector), its `width` (float), and its `height` (float), but we also store [its halfspace representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope#Intersection_of_half-spaces).
# In this representation, a stepping stone is described by a matrix $A$ and a vector $b$ such that a point $x \in \mathbb R^2$ lies inside the stepping stone iff $A x \leq b$.
# Each row of the matrix $A$ represents one of the four halfspaces that delimit a 2d rectangle.
# We will need these matrices later in the notebook when we will use an MIP technique known as [the big-M method](https://optimization.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Disjunctive_inequalities).

# The following class that takes a list of boolean values (e.g. `bool_bridge = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`) and generates a collection of stepping stones.
# We have the `initial` stepping stone on the left, the `goal` stepping stone on the right, the `lateral` stepping stone at the top, and a set of `bridge` stepping stones that connect the `initial` stone to the `goal`.
# With all the `bridge` stepping stones in place, there would be an easy path for the robot to reach the `goal`.

# ## The Mixed-Integer Optimization Problem
#
# It's time to write the core of the footstep planner: the MIQP.
# We start by defining the decision variables.
# We do this inside of a function, since we ultimately want to define a `footstep_planner` function that given a `terrain` (and a couple of additional parameters) returns the optimal plan to walk through it.
#
# Here is the meaning of the variables in the following function:
# - `n_steps` is the maximum number of steps that the robot can take to reach the goal.
# - The 2d array `position_left[t]` contains the Cartesian coordinates of the left foot at step `t`.
# Similarly for `position_right[t]`.
# - If the binary variable `stone_left[t, i]` is one then, at step `t`, the left foot must be placed on stone `i`.
# Since a foot cannot be in two stepping stones at the same time, below we will also add the constraint `sum(stone_left[t]) == 1`.
# Similarly for `stone_right[t, i]`.
# - The binary `first_left` is one if the first step is taken with the left foot, zero if it is taken with the right foot.

# The following constraint is somewhat involved to implement, but the idea behind it is straightforward.
# If we take the first step with, e.g., the left foot (`first_left == 1`), then we implicitly associated each step in the plan to a foot; using zero-based indexing: 0th step left, 1st step right, 2nd step left, 3rd step right, etc.
# The following function ensures that, if we move the left foot first, then the left foot will not move during an "odd" step and the right foot will not move during an "even" step.
# Similarly if we decide to take the first step with the right foot.
#
# Here is how we implemented it.
# At each step `t`, we require the next position of a foot to lie in a square centered at its current position.
# We then use the binaries `first_left` and `first_right = 1 - first_left` to make the side of this square sufficiently large or zero, depending on whether the foot is allowed to move at step `t`.

# We define a binary $\delta_{t, i} \in \{0, 1\}$ per stepping stone (these are the binaries `stone_left[t, i]` we defined above).
# We add the constraint
# $$
# A_i x_t \leq b_i + (1 - \delta_{t, i}) M_i

# for all $t$.
#
# Do you see how these two constraints do the job?
# If $\delta_{t, i} = 1$, from the last equation, we must have $\delta_{t, j} = 0$ for all $j \neq i$.
# This implies
# $$
# A_i x_t \leq b_i, \quad
# A_j x_t \leq b_j + M_j.
# $$
# Therefore $x_t$ belongs to $S_i$, while, since $M_j$ is a vector of large constants, the second inequality is redundant and does not constrain the value of $x_t$.
#
# It's very important to notice that these constraints are linear in our decision variables ($x_t$ and $\delta_{t, i}$).
# Mixed-integer programs with nonlinear constraints are extremely hard problems, especially if some of the constraints are nonconvex.
#
# One issue left: what's the magic value for the constants $M_i$?
# One would be tempted to put a huge number there, but unfortunately the larger the $M_i$ the harder the problem is to be solved via branch and bound.
# In the following cell we wrote a function that returns a vector $M$ that can be used for all $i$.
# (This is possible since our stepping stones are rectangles and they all have the same number of facets, 4, which is equal to the number of rows in $A_i$).
# If you are not a MIP enthusiast, do not feel the need to understand the logic behind the following function.
