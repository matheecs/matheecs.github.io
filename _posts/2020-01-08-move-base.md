**Recovery Behavior**

![](https://tva4.sinaimg.cn/large/d494c514gy1gaq56bliofj20jr07qdgq.jpg)

The `move_base` node may optionally perform recovery behaviors when the robot perceives itself as stuck. By default, the `move_base` node will take the following actions to attempt to **clear out space**:

1. First, obstacles outside of a user-specified region will be cleared from the robot's map.
2. Next, if possible, the robot will perform an in-place rotation to clear out space.
3. If this too fails, the robot will more aggressively clear its map, removing all obstacles outside of the rectangular region in which it can rotate in place. This will be followed by another in-place rotation.
4. If all this fails, the robot will consider its goal infeasible and notify the user that it has aborted.

These recovery behaviors can be configured using the `recovery_behaviors` parameter, and disabled using the `recovery_behavior_enabled` parameter.
