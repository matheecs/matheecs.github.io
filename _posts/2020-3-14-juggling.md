- A throw of “0” in a site svape, is not a throw, as this is a designation that there is no ball in hand.
- “1” is a quick horizontal throw from one hand to the other.
- “2” - formally, this is a small toss in the hand, but in practice, the ball is not thrown away, but simply held in the hand.
- The average value of all digits of a website is equal to the number of balls.
