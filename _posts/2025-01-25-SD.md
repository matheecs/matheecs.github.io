Hi all, just a quick note about Desktop mode after the latest Steam Deck Stable software update:

In Desktop mode, holding the Menu ( â‰¡ ) button will swap between desktop oriented and gamepad oriented controls. You'll see a Steam notification when you change modes.

```bash
sudo steamos-readonly disable

sudo systemctl enable sshd

sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
sudo pacman-key --populate holo
```
